##Python Automation using Selenium
Developed an automated Python tool leveraging Selenium for web data extraction. The tool performs Google searches based on input from an Excel sheet, extracts search results, and processes them to identify key data points, such as the longest and shortest sentences. The results are dynamically updated in the Excel sheet, streamlining the data collection and analysis process.
##Key Features:
 #Automated web search and data extraction using Selenium, improving efficiency in data retrieval tasks.
 #Scripted logic to manipulate and update Excel files programmatically with Python.
 #Ensured cross-browser compatibility by managing Chromedriver versions, aligning with specific Google Chrome versions on Linux.
 #Enhanced data handling, improving both accuracy and speed in large-scale web searches and analyses.
